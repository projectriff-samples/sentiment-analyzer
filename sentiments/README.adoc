=== about

This function performs sentiment analysis using the https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/[textblob] natural language processing package.
It is intendended to work with a twitter feed, rendered as json. The analyzer only looks at the `text` field, so any valid json containing 
`text` will work. The output includes the text along with a computed polarity indicating the sentiment. The value ranges from -1.0 to 1.0, where 
0.0 is neutral, and values reflect the degree positive or negative sentiment accordingly. 

To run this as a riff function, follow the instructions below.  

To test it standalone, install python 3.6, pip and 
```
$ pip install textblob
```

Run it against sample tweets
```
$ ./sentiments.py < tweets.txt
```

or manually input json from the command line 

```
$./sentiments.py
{"text":"happy happy happy"}
```

=== prerequisites
